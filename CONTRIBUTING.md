# Contributing to GroveOS

As an open-source project, GroveOS welcomes contributions! Please follow this simple guide
that will show you how to contribute to GroveOS.

Before you begin contributing, make sure to fork the repository so you have your own copy to work with..

## Finding an Issue

To begin contributing to GroveOS, find a currently open issue that you'd like to work on solving.
If you can't find a currently open issue of something that you want to work on, feel free to create one!

All PRs must be connected to an issue(s), so it's best if you find an issue before you start working.

## Implementation

Implement your solution to the issue! Please follow the established code style and make sure that your code
is properly documented and as clean as can be.

Be sure that you are implementing your solution on a new branch of your fork.

## Checking Your Code

Before you open a PR, please make sure your code is solid using `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
These are run on new PRs, so it's best to make sure that they pass on your code before creating the PR.

## Create a PR

Open a new PR requesting to merge your branch into main. Fill out the PR template to the best of your ability,
describing what you changed and why.

Make sure to link at least one issue to your PR that your PR will resolve.

## Wait for a Review

After your PR is opened, wait for a maintainer to review your changes. We may request changes to your work, so be
prepared to change some things around before having your PR merged.

## PR Fate

After everything else is complete, maintainers will decide whether to merge your PR or to close it. If we decide to close
your PR, we will be sure to explain why we made this decision. Most PRs will be merged if all of the above steps are followed.
